# üèãÔ∏è Lift It Up Right: A Recommender System for Safer Lifting Postures

This repository contains the official implementation of our paper **"Lift It Up Right: A Recommender System for Safer Lifting Postures"**, a system designed to assess and improve lifting posture using ergonomic principles and computer vision.

> ‚úÖ **Tested with Python 3.11**  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Can be adapted to other Python versions with minor changes (modifications are up to the user)

## üì¶ Dataset

- The dataset will be **released upon paper acceptance**.
- Once available, place all dataset archives inside the `archives_data/` folder.
- **Important:** All `.zip` files should be extracted in-place (in the same folder where they were downloaded).

## üìä Evaluation

### Questions for Video-Specific Evaluation

For each video, the ergonomists answered the following questions:

1. **How would you rate the quality of the system‚Äôs recommendation?**  
   (1 = Very poor | 2 = Poor | 3 = Fair | 4 = Good | 5 = Excellent)

2. **How effective do you think the recommendation would be at reducing the risk of injury?**  
   (1 = Not at all effective | 2 = Slightly effective | 3 = Moderately effective | 4 = Very effective | 5 = Extremely effective)

3. **How clear was the recommendation in terms of what specific action should be taken?**  
   (1 = Very unclear | 2 = Unclear | 3 = Neutral | 4 = Clear | 5 = Very clear)

4. **How appropriate was the system‚Äôs recommendation for addressing the observed posture issue?**  
   (1 = Very inappropriate | 2 = Inappropriate | 3 = Neutral | 4 = Appropriate | 5 = Very appropriate)

### Questions for Overall System Evaluation

At the end of the evaluation, the ergonomists answered the following questions to assess the overall system:

1. **Do you find the system‚Äôs recommendations to be adaptive to different types of posture problems?**  
   (1 = Very repetitive | 2 = Somewhat repetitive | 3 = Neutral | 4 = Diverse | 5 = Highly adaptive)

2. **Is the information provided alongside the recommendation sufficient for the user to understand how to improve their posture?**  
   (1 = Not sufficient at all | 2 = Slightly sufficient | 3 = Moderately sufficient | 4 = Very sufficient | 5 = Completely sufficient)

3. **After seeing the feedback, do you think the system helped explain why the initial posture was risky in terms of injury prevention or discomfort?**  
   (1 = Not at all | 2 = Slightly | 3 = Moderately | 4 = Very | 5 = Completely)

4. **Do you think this system could be effectively integrated into a real-world training or workplace environment to address posture-related issues?**  
   (1 = Not useful at all | 2 = Slightly useful | 3 = Moderately useful | 4 = Very useful | 5 = Extremely useful)

5. **Do you think this system helps identify posture-related problems that are otherwise difficult to explain or understand for users?**  
   (1 = Strongly disagree | 2 = Disagree | 3 = Neutral | 4 = Agree | 5 = Strongly agree)
